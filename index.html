            <p>To keep your dog healthy, provide regular vet check-ups for vaccinations, dental care, and overall health monitoring. Ensure your dog is eating a balanced diet with high-quality dog food suited to their age and health conditions. Make sure they get plenty of exercise to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
            <p>Watch out for any unusual behavior such as changes in eating habits, lethargy, or excessive panting, and consult a vet immediately if you notice anything concerning. Regular walks and playtime are great for your dog’s physical and mental health.</p>

            <h2>Toys and Entertainment</h2>
            <p>Dogs are playful animals that need regular entertainment. Providing a variety of toys that stimulate their minds and keep them active is important. Interactive toys, puzzle feeders, and chew toys are great for mental stimulation and preventing boredom.</p>
            <p>Always rotate their toys to keep things interesting. Balls, ropes, and frisbees are excellent for active dogs that enjoy fetching. You can also try using puzzle games to challenge your dog’s problem-solving skills.</p>

            <p>Spending quality time with your dog strengthens your bond and keeps them emotionally happy. Regular grooming is important for their hygiene and well-being. Dogs love cuddles, and they thrive in environments where they feel secure and part of the family.</p>
