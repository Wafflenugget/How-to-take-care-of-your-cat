            <p>To keep your cat healthy, provide regular vet check-ups, vaccinations, and dental care. A balanced diet with high-quality cat food is essential for their well-being. Cats also need to stay hydrated, so always make sure they have access to fresh water.</p>
            <p>Regular playtime and exercise will help maintain a healthy weight and prevent obesity. Keep an eye out for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, lethargy, or unusual behavior, and consult a vet if needed.</p>

            <p>Cats are playful and curious, so providing them with a variety of toys is important for their mental and physical stimulation. Toys like feathers, balls, and puzzle feeders can keep your cat entertained for hours.</p>
            <p>Interactive toys, such as laser pointers or catnip-filled objects, will engage your cat and encourage them to stay active. Make sure to rotate toys regularly to keep your cat interested and avoid boredom.</p>

            <h2>Vital Things for Happiness</h2>
            <p>Your cat's happiness depends on feeling loved and secure. Provide a safe space, like a cozy bed or a window perch, where your cat can relax. Cats also enjoy scratching posts to help keep their claws healthy and sharp.</p>
            <p>Spend time with your cat daily, whether it's cuddling, petting, or playing. Regular grooming, including brushing their fur and trimming their nails, is important for their hygiene. Cats thrive in an environment that is clean and calm, so make sure they have a peaceful place to retreat to when they need it.</p>
