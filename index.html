    <!-- Health Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>To keep your cat healthy, provide regular vet check-ups for vaccinations, dental care, and overall health monitoring. Ensure your cat is eating a balanced diet with high-quality cat food suited to their age and health conditions. Don't forget to maintain their litter box hygiene, as cleanliness helps prevent urinary or digestive issues.</p>
        <p>Watch out for any unusual behavior such as changes in eating habits, lethargy, or excessive grooming, and consult a vet immediately if you notice anything concerning. Regular exercise through play helps maintain their physical and mental well-being.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Toys and Entertainment Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Toys and Entertainment</h2>
        <p>Cats are natural hunters, and toys that mimic prey, such as feather wands or laser pointers, can provide great entertainment. Rotating their toys keeps them engaged and prevents boredom. Consider investing in puzzle toys or interactive feeders to stimulate their intelligence.</p>
        <p>Scratching posts are essential for a catâ€™s well-being as they help maintain their claws and prevent furniture damage. Cat trees or shelves can provide climbing opportunities, satisfying their instinct to explore vertical spaces.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Vital Things Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Vital Things for Happiness</h2>
        <p>A happy cat is one that feels safe and loved. Provide a cozy bed or hiding spots where they can relax undisturbed. Ensure they always have access to fresh water, preferably in a fountain, as cats often prefer running water.</p>
        <p>Spending quality time with your cat strengthens your bond and reduces stress for both of you. Grooming your cat regularly not only keeps their coat shiny and mat-free but also shows your care for them.</p>
